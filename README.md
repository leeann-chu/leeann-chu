  📥 __Voting__
    - vote anonymously, automatically counts votes and displays winner

* 🎮 [Adventure-like](https://github.com/leeann-chu/adventure-like) | WIP. Will eventually become a [*Colossal Cave Adventure*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colossal_Cave_Adventure) inspired terminal-only game. Created with friends from home
